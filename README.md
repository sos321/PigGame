# Pig Game

In this game two players roll a virtual dice and try to get to 100 points.
But it isn't that easy, if you roll a 1 you lose all your currently accumulated points and the other player rolls.

My second JS project that showed me greater depths of JS.

This project was created while taking the [JavaScript course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) from Jonas Schmedtmann.
Other notes and projects as well as the main repo for this course can be found [here](https://github.com/sos321/javascript-course).
